## ~~p~~act

[pact](http://pact.io/) simplified - less is more as one famous guy said


* Pact workflow:

1) client defines, test itself against, and publishes contract(s)
2) provider(s) verifies contract
3) client deploys


* act workflow:
1) client defines, test itself against, publishes contract(s) and deploys


act performs contract validation when the contract gets publishes allowing step 2 and 3 in the pact workflow to be eliminated.
